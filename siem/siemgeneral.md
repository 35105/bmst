# SIEM

SEM (Security Event Management) refers to security software that identifies, collects, monitors, and correlates real-time events and alerts from various log sources like workstations, intrusion detection systems, antivirus programs, and firewalls.

SIM (Security Information Management) involves specialized software that collects, monitors, and analyzes data and event logs from network endpoints and security devices, including intrusion detection systems and firewalls.

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a software solution that consolidates and analyzes activities across an organization’s IT infrastructure. It combines SEM and SIM to detect threats and transform log entries and security events into actionable insights.

Log refers to data generated by systems and applications that record actions taken, such as user logins on a Windows system.

WEL (Windows Event Logs) are binary files (.evtx) stored in the Windows directory, documenting all activities on a Windows system, including user logins and program executions.

Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows service that logs system activity to the event log, providing more detailed information than standard Windows Event logs.

Regex (Regular Expression) is a text string that creates patterns for matching and managing text, useful for finding specific files or data on a system via the command line.

API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that enables communication between software applications, allowing for data retrieval and interaction. Accessing the API of a SIEM product lets users query it for information to power dashboards that display metrics like firewall actions and alert counts.

## Sigma

analysts can describe their detection methods and make them shareable with others. Rules can be written in the Sigma language and then using a converter (Sigmac) they can be exported as rules in the correct format for a number of different SIEM platforms, can be reversed too.

There are some great real-world rules to take a look at on Florian Roth’s Github page GitHub – Neo23x0/sigma: Generic Signature Format for SIEM Systems. Additional rules are available at https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules.
