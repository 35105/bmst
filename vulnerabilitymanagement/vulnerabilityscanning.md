## Nmap Commands

nmap -sS target                     Performs a TCP SYN scan to identify open ports stealthily.<br>
nmap -sT target                     Conducts a TCP connect scan to find open ports by establishing full connections.<br>
nmap -sU target                     Scans for open UDP ports on the target.<br>
nmap -p port target                 Scans specific port(s) or a range (e.g., -p 22,80).<br>
nmap -A target                      Enables OS detection, version detection, and script scanning for detailed information.<br>
nmap -O target                      Attempts to determine the operating system of the target.<br>
nmap -sV target                     Detects service versions running on open ports.<br>
nmap -Pn target                     Skips host discovery, treating all specified hosts as online, useful for firewalled hosts.<br>
nmap -T4 target                     Sets the timing template to speed up the scan (T4 is faster but may be more detectable).<br>
nmap -oN filename target            Outputs scan results to a file in normal format.<br>
nmap -oX filename target            Outputs scan results to a file in XML format.<br>
nmap --script script target         Runs a specific Nmap script against the target for additional checks (e.g., --script http-enum).<br>
nmap -sP target                     Performs a ping scan to discover live hosts on the network.<br>
nmap -6 target                      Scans for IPv6 addresses.<br>
